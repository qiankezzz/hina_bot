Studies generally report negative associations between mobile phone use (MPU) and\r\nwell-being. However, few studies contrast the relationship of MPU with different concepts of positive psy\u0002chology. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between MPU and different concepts of po\u0002sitive psychology: life satisfaction, well-being, and mindfulness. Data from 461 German speaking participants\r\nanswering an online-questionnaire were analyzed. Overall, results suggest that participants who use their mobile\r\nphones more often report lower well-being, life satisfaction, and mindfulness scores. Furthermore, results imply\r\nthat the relationships between positive psychology concepts and MPU differ between men and women. Results\r\nindicate that MPU and its associations with concepts of positive psychology are relevant areas for research and\r\ndeserve more attention.", "author": "user", "from": {"id": "1055519054066995", "name": null}, "createdAt": "2023-05-02T03:22:21.9809623+00:00", "timestamp": "2023-05-02T03:22:21.9781218+00:00", "locale": "en-us", "market": "en-us", "region": "us", "messageId": "ee151380-a929-4250-909c-ac5cc79d4f21", "requestId": "ee151380-a929-4250-909c-ac5cc79d4f21", "nlu": {"scoredClassification": {"classification": "DEEP_LEO", "score": null}, "classificationRanking": [{"classification": "DEEP_LEO", "score": null}], "qualifyingClassifications": null, "ood": null, "metaData": null, "entities": null}, "offense": "None", "feedback": {"tag": null, "updatedOn": null, "type": "None"}, "contentOrigin": "cib", "privacy": null, "inputMethod": "Keyboard"}, {"text": "A possible summary of the passage by the requested contents is:\n\n- Background information: Mobile phones are criticized for harming well-being, but few studies compare different positive psychology concepts.\n- Research gaps: The relationship between mobile phone use and life satisfaction, well-being, and mindfulness is unclear and may vary by gender.\n- Aim: To investigate the relationship between mobile phone use and these three positive psychology concepts.\n- Method: Online-questionnaire with 461 German speaking participants.\n- Results: More mobile phone use is linked to lower scores on all three concepts, and the associations differ between men and women.", "author": "bot", "createdAt": "2023-05-02T03:22:26.3813027+00:00", "timestamp": "2023-05-02T03:22:26.3813027+00:00", "messageId": "b78ce7e6-e932-4017-aeab-41a8ef3fb796", "requestId": "ee151380-a929-4250-909c-ac5cc79d4f21", "offense": "None", "adaptiveCards": [{"type": "AdaptiveCard", "version": "1.0", "body": [{"type": "TextBlock", "text": "A possible summary of the passage by the requested contents is:\n\n- Background information: Mobile phones are criticized for harming well-being, but few studies compare different positive psychology concepts.\n- Research gaps: The relationship between mobile phone use and life satisfaction, well-being, and mindfulness is unclear and may vary by gender.\n- Aim: To investigate the relationship between mobile phone use and these three positive psychology concepts.\n- Method: Online-questionnaire with 461 German speaking participants.\n- Results: More mobile phone use is linked to lower scores on all three concepts, and the associations differ between men and women.", "wrap": true}]}], "sourceAttributions": [], "feedback": {"tag": null, "updatedOn": null, "type": "None"}, "contentOrigin": "DeepLeo", "privacy": null, "suggestedResponses": [{"text": "Thank you for the summary.", "author": "user", "createdAt": "2023-05-02T03:22:33.7687686+00:00", "timestamp": "2023-05-02T03:22:33.7687686+00:00", "messageId": "d40b1c3c-5f3a-43ba-942d-a2c29e27708f", "messageType": "Suggestion", "offense": "Unknown", "feedback": {"tag": null, "updatedOn": null, "type": "None"}, "contentOrigin": "DeepLeo", "privacy": null}, {"text": "Can you rewrite the summary in a different way?", "author": "user", "createdAt": "2023-05-02T03:22:33.7687703+00:00", "timestamp": "2023-05-02T03:22:33.7687703+00:00", "messageId": "810c8b13-0402-4571-9ed6-f1ec93e4f39a", "messageType": "Suggestion", "offense": "Unknown", "feedback": {"tag": null, "updatedOn": null, "type": "None"}, "contentOrigin": "DeepLeo", "privacy": null}, {"text": "Can you generate a title for the passage?", "author": "user", "createdAt": "2023-05-02T03:22:33.7687706+00:00", "timestamp": "2023-05-02T03:22:33.7687706+00:00", "messageId": "790c98f2-4ac4-48ce-8a2f-3e6da427ca04", "messageType": "Suggestion", "offense": "Unknown", "feedback": {"tag": null, "updatedOn": null, "type": "None"}, "contentOrigin": "DeepLeo", "privacy": null}], "spokenText": "Results: More mobile phone use is linked to lower scores on all three concepts, and the associations differ between men and women."}], "firstNewMessageIndex": 1, "defaultChatName": null, "conversationId": "51D|BingProd|096A35C3A358C505213EDD27E07EB1A71A39A8F709D403486207003CA062738C", "requestId": "ee151380-a929-4250-909c-ac5cc79d4f21", "conversationExpiryTime": "2023-05-02T09:22:33.8501131Z", "shouldInitiateConversation": true, "telemetry": {"metrics": null, "startTime": "2023-05-02T03:22:21.9781977Z"}, "throttling": {"maxNumUserMessagesInConversation": 20, "numUserMessagesInConversation": 1}, "result": {"value": "Success", "serviceVersion": "20230501.30"}}}
