{"type": 2, "invocationId": "0", "item": {"messages": [{"text": "The following passage:\nThis short essay first summarizes the definition of \"lying flat\" and introduces some surveys about the effects of \"lying flat\". Then, it dialectically discusses the positive and negative impacts of \"lying flat\" on college students' academic performance.\nRecent surveys reveal that only a small number of people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d really. For example, according to the Investigation Report on Social Mentality of Young Netizens in China (2009-2021), up to 75.0% of the youths express positive orientations while only a small number of young people support \"lying flat\". Besides, there are also 21.3% of young people who have expressed both the intention of struggling and the intention of \"lying flat\" with similar frequency, which belongs to mixed attitudes. In addition, many studies prove that \"lying flat\" has both negative and positive impacts in many fields such as society, education, and the economy. In this passage, we only discuss the effects on college students' academic performance.\nAs the population soars and Covid-19 epidemics rife throughout the world, the general economy declines badly and competition among people has become more and more fierce, also called involution's aggravation, which leads to some people giving up working or studying hard and doing everything from their hearts without caring about others' criticisms. And these behaviors are almost the definition of \"lying flat\". So, how many people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d in China? It is worth exploring how many people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d in China and what are the effects of this phenomenon on college students' academic performance.\nFirst of all, there is no denying that \"lying flat\" will destroy college students' momentum of learning and doing scientific research. It is universally acknowledged that if one student gives up studying for a long time, it will be hard for him to get confidence again and restart his study. We can easily conclude that it is an irreparable loss for high schools to lose numbers of potentially excellent students and the output of scientific research. For instance, Wu Gangzhou, a student of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, who published more than ten SCI papers, and seven papers included in SCI published by the first author during his postgraduate period, had a dull life in the first three years of his college and began to \"wake up\" suddenly and catch up in his junior year. If he chose to \u201clie flat\u201d for another four years, he absolutely won't make these achievements. \nWhat's more, \"lying flat\" has many adverse effects on different aspects of learning ability. Not only may it cause the decline of language expression ability, but also it may make your memory decline and make it difficult for you to concentrate. As a result, \"lying flat\" for a long time will directly lower students' academic performance.\nOn the hand, \"lying flat\" for a short time can release college students' pressure and let them introspect themselves, which can help them get a calmer mind. Besides, they can do things they want without anxiety when they \u201clie flat\u201d, which may give them opportunities of adjusting their mindset and find the meaning of life for them.\nIn conclusion, to some extent \"lying flat\" is harmful to college students but it also has some advantages. In my opinion, college students need to strike a proper balance between work and rest, rather than choose an extreme tendency \u2013 living all days in anxiety because of involution, or giving up all things and then lying flat forever.", "author": "user", "from": {"id": "1055519054066995", "name": null}, "createdAt": "2023-04-22T18:06:24.5374888+00:00", "timestamp": "2023-04-22T18:06:24.534514+00:00", "locale": "en-us", "market": "en-us", "region": "us", "messageId": "b98d23c0-2d0d-448a-a156-0f10af06d77b", "requestId": "b98d23c0-2d0d-448a-a156-0f10af06d77b", "nlu": {"scoredClassification": {"classification": "DEEP_LEO", "score": null}, "classificationRanking": [{"classification": "DEEP_LEO", "score": null}], "qualifyingClassifications": null, "ood": null, "metaData": null, "entities": null}, "offense": "None", "feedback": {"tag": null, "updatedOn": null, "type": "None"}, "contentOrigin": "cib", "privacy": null, "inputMethod": "Keyboard"}, {"text": "Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with rewriting, improving, or optimizing your passage.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI noticed that your passage is about the phenomenon of \"lying flat\" in China and its effects on college students' academic performance. According to some web sources[^1^] [^2^] [^3^], \"lying flat\" is a social movement and lifestyle that rejects the pressure to work hard and pursue material success, and instead adopts a more leisurely and nonmaterialistic approach to life. Some young people and college students in China have chosen to \"lie flat\" as a way of coping with the competitive and stressful society.\n\nYour passage has a clear structure and some good points, but it can be improved in several ways. Here are some suggestions:\n\n- You should start with an introduction that provides some background information on the topic and states your main argument or thesis statement. Your current introduction is too long and contains some details that belong to the body paragraphs. For example, you can briefly explain what \"lying flat\" is and why it is relevant to college students, and then state your position on whether it is beneficial or harmful to their academic performance.\n- You should organize your body paragraphs according to the main points you want to make, and use topic sentences to introduce each point. You should also use transitions to connect your paragraphs and show how they relate to each other. For example, you can have one paragraph that discusses the negative effects of \"lying flat\" on college students' motivation, confidence, and learning ability, and another paragraph that discusses the positive effects of \"lying flat\" on college students' mental health, happiness, and self-discovery. You can use words like \"however\", \"on the other hand\", or \"in contrast\" to show the contrast between the two perspectives.\n- You should support your points with evidence from credible sources, such as surveys, studies, or experts' opinions. You should also cite your sources properly using a consistent format, such as APA or MLA. For example, you can use some statistics from the Investigation Report on Social Mentality of Young Netizens in China (2009-2021) or some findings from the Analysis on the Psychological Causes of \"Lying Flat\" Behavior of College Students[^5^] to back up your claims. You should also explain how the evidence supports your point and address any possible counterarguments or limitations.\n- You should end with a conclusion that summarizes your main points and restates your thesis statement. You should also provide some implications or recommendations for further research or action on the topic. For example, you can suggest some ways that college students can balance their work and rest, or some policies that can improve their education and employment opportunities.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful for you.
