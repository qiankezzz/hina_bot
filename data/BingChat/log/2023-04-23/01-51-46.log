Then, it dialectically discusses the positive and negative impacts of \"lying flat\" on college students' academic performance.\nRecent surveys reveal that only a small number of people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d really. For example, according to the Investigation Report on Social Mentality of Young Netizens in China (2009-2021), up to 75.0% of the youths express positive orientations while only a small number of young people support \"lying flat\". Besides, there are also 21.3% of young people who have expressed both the intention of struggling and the intention of \"lying flat\" with similar frequency, which belongs to mixed attitudes. In addition, many studies prove that \"lying flat\" has both negative and positive impacts in many fields such as society, education, and the economy. In this passage, we only discuss the effects on college students' academic performance.\nAs the population soars and Covid-19 epidemics rife throughout the world, the general economy declines badly and competition among people has become more and more fierce, also called involution's aggravation, which leads to some people giving up working or studying hard and doing everything from their hearts without caring about others' criticisms. And these behaviors are almost the definition of \"lying flat\". So, how many people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d in China? It is worth exploring how many people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d in China and what are the effects of this phenomenon on college students' academic performance.\nFirst of all, there is no denying that \"lying flat\" will destroy college students' momentum of learning and doing scientific research. It is universally acknowledged that if one student gives up studying for a long time, it will be hard for him to get confidence again and restart his study. We can easily conclude that it is an irreparable loss for high schools to lose numbers of potentially excellent students and the output of scientific research. For instance, Wu Gangzhou, a student of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, who published more than ten SCI papers, and seven papers included in SCI published by the first author during his postgraduate period, had a dull life in the first three years of his college and began to \"wake up\" suddenly and catch up in his junior year. If he chose to \u201clie flat\u201d for another four years, he absolutely won't make these achievements. \nWhat's more, \"lying flat\" has many adverse effects on different aspects of learning ability. Not only may it cause the decline of language expression ability, but also it may make your memory decline and make it difficult for you to concentrate. As a result, \"lying flat\" for a long time will directly lower students' academic performance.\nOn the hand, \"lying flat\" for a short time can release college students' pressure and let them introspect themselves, which can help them get a calmer mind. Besides, they can do things they want without anxiety when they \u201clie flat\u201d, which may give them opportunities of adjusting their mindset and find the meaning of life for them.\nIn conclusion, to some extent \"lying flat\" is harmful to college students but it also has some advantages. In my opinion, college students need to strike a proper balance between work and rest, rather than choose an extreme tendency \u2013 living all days in anxiety because of involution, or giving up all things and then lying flat forever.", "author": "user", "from": {"id": "1055519054066995", "name": null}, "createdAt": "2023-04-22T17:51:35.0760483+00:00", "timestamp": "2023-04-22T17:51:35.0731589+00:00", "locale": "en-us", "market": "en-us", "region": "us", "messageId": "24563fce-d189-4f0a-be22-3bacf6b865c4", "requestId": "24563fce-d189-4f0a-be22-3bacf6b865c4", "nlu": {"scoredClassification": {"classification": "DEEP_LEO", "score": null}, "classificationRanking": [{"classification": "DEEP_LEO", "score": null}], "qualifyingClassifications": null, "ood": null, "metaData": null, "entities": null}, "offense": "None", "feedback": {"tag": null, "updatedOn": null, "type": "None"}, "contentOrigin": "cib", "privacy": null, "inputMethod": "Keyboard"}, {"text": "Hello, this is Bing.
