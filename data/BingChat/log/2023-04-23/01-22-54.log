{"type": 2, "invocationId": "0", "item": {"messages": [{"text": "The following passage:\nThis short essay first summarizes the definition of \"lying flat\" and introduces some surveys about the effects of \"lying flat\". Then, it dialectically discusses the positive and negative impacts of \"lying flat\" on college students' academic performance.\nRecent surveys reveal that only a small number of people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d really. For example, according to the Investigation Report on Social Mentality of Young Netizens in China (2009-2021), up to 75.0% of the youths express positive orientations while only a small number of young people support \"lying flat\". Besides, there are also 21.3% of young people who have expressed both the intention of struggling and the intention of \"lying flat\" with similar frequency, which belongs to mixed attitudes. In addition, many studies prove that \"lying flat\" has both negative and positive impacts in many fields such as society, education, and the economy. In this passage, we only discuss the effects on college students' academic performance.\nAs the population soars and Covid-19 epidemics rife throughout the world, the general economy declines badly and competition among people has become more and more fierce, also called involution's aggravation, which leads to some people giving up working or studying hard and doing everything from their hearts without caring about others' criticisms. And these behaviors are almost the definition of \"lying flat\". So, how many people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d in China? It is worth exploring how many people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d in China and what are the effects of this phenomenon on college students' academic performance.\nFirst of all, there is no denying that \"lying flat\" will destroy college students' momentum of learning and doing scientific research. It is universally acknowledged that if one student gives up studying for a long time, it will be hard for him to get confidence again and restart his study. We can easily conclude that it is an irreparable loss for high schools to lose numbers of potentially excellent students and the output of scientific research. For instance, Wu Gangzhou, a student of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, who published more than ten SCI papers, and seven papers included in SCI published by the first author during his postgraduate period, had a dull life in the first three years of his college and began to \"wake up\" suddenly and catch up in his junior year. If he chose to \u201clie flat\u201d for another four years, he absolutely won't make these achievements. \nWhat's more, \"lying flat\" has many adverse effects on different aspects of learning ability. Not only may it cause the decline of language expression ability, but also it may make your memory decline and make it difficult for you to concentrate. As a result, \"lying flat\" for a long time will directly lower students' academic performance.\nOn the hand, \"lying flat\" for a short time can release college students' pressure and let them introspect themselves, which can help them get a calmer mind. Besides, they can do things they want without anxiety when they \u201clie flat\u201d, which may give them opportunities of adjusting their mindset and find the meaning of life for them.\nIn conclusion, to some extent \"lying flat\" is harmful to college students but it also has some advantages. In my opinion, college students need to strike a proper balance between work and rest, rather than choose an extreme tendency \u2013 living all days in anxiety because of involution, or giving up all things and then lying flat forever.", "author": "user", "from": {"id": "1055519054066995", "name": null}, "createdAt": "2023-04-22T17:21:40.6638101+00:00", "timestamp": "2023-04-22T17:21:40.660967+00:00", "locale": "en-us", "market": "en-us", "region": "us", "messageId": "e8207074-3e15-45be-9dab-1b3ab7f04062", "requestId": "e8207074-3e15-45be-9dab-1b3ab7f04062", "nlu": {"scoredClassification": {"classification": "DEEP_LEO", "score": null}, "classificationRanking": [{"classification": "DEEP_LEO", "score": null}], "qualifyingClassifications": null, "ood": null, "metaData": null, "entities": null}, "offense": "None", "feedback": {"tag": null, "updatedOn": null, "type": "None"}, "contentOrigin": "cib", "privacy": null, "inputMethod": "Keyboard"}, {"text": "Hello, this is Bing. I can help you with rewriting, improving, or optimizing your passage.\ud83d\ude0a\n\nI assume you are writing a short essay on the topic of \"lying flat\" and its effects on college students' academic performance. \"Lying flat\" is a Chinese social movement and lifestyle whose followers adopt a more leisurely and nonmaterialistic life in rejection of professional demands and societal expectations[^1^] [^3^]. It became popular in 2021 as many people felt they were under increasing pressure to work harder and outperform their peers[^2^].\n\nHere are some suggestions to improve your passage:\n\n- The first paragraph should be an introduction that provides some background information on the topic, states the main argument or thesis, and outlines the main points of the essay. You can use a hook to capture the reader's attention, such as a question, a quote, a statistic, or an anecdote. For example:\n\n> Have you ever felt exhausted by the endless competition and pressure in your academic or professional life? If so, you are not alone. Many people in China have adopted a new way of coping with the stress and anxiety of modern society: lying flat. Lying flat is a social movement and lifestyle that rejects the pursuit of material success and opts for a more relaxed and simple life. But what are the effects of lying flat on college students' academic performance? In this essay, I will summarize the definition and prevalence of lying flat, and discuss its positive and negative impacts on college students' learning outcomes.\n\n- The second paragraph should be a summary of the definition and prevalence of lying flat, based on reliable sources. You can use some statistics or examples to support your claims. For example:\n\n> Lying flat is a translation of the Chinese phrase tang ping, which means taking a break from relentless work. It emerged as a response to the 996 working culture, where people work from 9:00am to 9:00pm, six days a week[^2^]. Many people who follow lying flat choose to quit their stressful jobs, reduce their consumption, and enjoy their hobbies and interests without worrying about others' opinions. According to a survey by Zhao pin, a leading career platform in China, only 3% of white-collar workers said they would choose lying flat as their ideal lifestyle, while 75% said they would still pursue their career goals[^4^]. However, some young people have expressed mixed attitudes towards lying flat, saying they sometimes feel like giving up but also want to achieve something in life[^2^].\n\n- The third paragraph should be a discussion of the negative impacts of lying flat on college students' academic performance. You can use some logical arguments or evidence to support your claims. For example:\n\n> Lying flat may have some negative impacts on college students' academic performance. First of all, lying flat may destroy college students' motivation and confidence in learning and doing research. If students give up studying for a long time, they may lose interest and passion in their fields of study, and find it hard to resume their academic activities. This may result in a loss of potential talent and innovation for society. For instance, Wu Gangzhou, a student of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, who published more than ten SCI papers during his postgraduate period, had a dull life in his first three years of college and only started to excel in his junior year. If he had chosen to lie flat for another four years, he would not have made these achievements[^2^]. Secondly, lying flat may impair college students' cognitive abilities and skills. Lying flat may cause students' language expression ability, memory capacity, and concentration level to decline over time. This may affect their academic performance and quality of work.\n\n- The fourth paragraph should be a discussion of the positive impacts of lying flat on college students' academic performance. You can use some logical arguments or evidence to support your claims. For example:\n\n> Lying flat may also have some positive impacts on college students' academic performance. First of all, lying flat may relieve college students' pressure and stress from studying and working hard. Many college students face high expectations from their parents, teachers, peers, and society to achieve academic excellence and secure good jobs. This may cause them to suffer from anxiety, depression, burnout, or other mental health issues. Lying flat may help them relax and enjoy their lives without being overwhelmed by external demands. This may improve their mental well-being and happiness. Secondly, lying flat may enable college students to reflect on themselves and explore their interests and values.
