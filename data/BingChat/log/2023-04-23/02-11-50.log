{"type": 2, "invocationId": "0", "item": {"messages": [{"text": "The following passage:\nThis short essay first summarizes the definition of \"lying flat\" and introduces some surveys about the effects of \"lying flat\". Then, it dialectically discusses the positive and negative impacts of \"lying flat\" on college students' academic performance.\nRecent surveys reveal that only a small number of people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d really. For example, according to the Investigation Report on Social Mentality of Young Netizens in China (2009-2021), up to 75.0% of the youths express positive orientations while only a small number of young people support \"lying flat\". Besides, there are also 21.3% of young people who have expressed both the intention of struggling and the intention of \"lying flat\" with similar frequency, which belongs to mixed attitudes. In addition, many studies prove that \"lying flat\" has both negative and positive impacts in many fields such as society, education, and the economy. In this passage, we only discuss the effects on college students' academic performance.\nAs the population soars and Covid-19 epidemics rife throughout the world, the general economy declines badly and competition among people has become more and more fierce, also called involution's aggravation, which leads to some people giving up working or studying hard and doing everything from their hearts without caring about others' criticisms. And these behaviors are almost the definition of \"lying flat\". So, how many people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d in China? It is worth exploring how many people choose to \u201clie flat\u201d in China and what are the effects of this phenomenon on college students' academic performance.\nFirst of all, there is no denying that \"lying flat\" will destroy college students' momentum of learning and doing scientific research. It is universally acknowledged that if one student gives up studying for a long time, it will be hard for him to get confidence again and restart his study. We can easily conclude that it is an irreparable loss for high schools to lose numbers of potentially excellent students and the output of scientific research. For instance, Wu Gangzhou, a student of Zhejiang Agriculture and Forestry University, who published more than ten SCI papers, and seven papers included in SCI published by the first author during his postgraduate period, had a dull life in the first three years of his college and began to \"wake up\" suddenly and catch up in his junior year. If he chose to \u201clie flat\u201d for another four years, he absolutely won't make these achievements. \nWhat's more, \"lying flat\" has many adverse effects on different aspects of learning ability. Not only may it cause the decline of language expression ability, but also it may make your memory decline and make it difficult for you to concentrate. As a result, \"lying flat\" for a long time will directly lower students' academic performance.\nOn the hand, \"lying flat\" for a short time can release college students' pressure and let them introspect themselves, which can help them get a calmer mind. Besides, they can do things they want without anxiety when they \u201clie flat\u201d, which may give them opportunities of adjusting their mindset and find the meaning of life for them.\nIn conclusion, to some extent \"lying flat\" is harmful to college students but it also has some advantages. In my opinion, college students need to strike a proper balance between work and rest, rather than choose an extreme tendency \u2013 living all days in anxiety because of involution, or giving up all things and then lying flat forever.", "author": "user", "from": {"id": "1055519054066995", "name": null}, "createdAt": "2023-04-22T18:11:16.6062546+00:00", "timestamp": "2023-04-22T18:11:16.6034277+00:00", "locale": "en-us", "market": "en-us", "region": "us", "messageId": "d30bc1d8-e6ec-4b95-87f5-944edd953447", "requestId": "d30bc1d8-e6ec-4b95-87f5-944edd953447", "nlu": {"scoredClassification": {"classification": "DEEP_LEO", "score": null}, "classificationRanking": [{"classification": "DEEP_LEO", "score": null}], "qualifyingClassifications": null, "ood": null, "metaData": null, "entities": null}, "offense": "None", "feedback": {"tag": null, "updatedOn": null, "type": "None"}, "contentOrigin": "cib", "privacy": null, "inputMethod": "Keyboard"}, {"text": "Hello, this is Bing.

According to the web search results[^1^] [^2^] [^3^], \"lying flat\" is a social movement and lifestyle whose followers adopt a more leisurely and nonmaterialistic life in rejection of professional demands and societal expectations. It is a response to the increasing pressure and competition in China's society, especially among the young generation.\n\nYour passage has a clear structure and some good examples, but it can be improved in several ways. Here are some suggestions:\n\n- You should write a clear thesis statement at the end of your introduction paragraph that summarizes your main argument and points. For example, you could write something like \"This essay argues that while 'lying flat' may have some benefits for college students' mental health and personal growth, it also has serious drawbacks for their academic performance and future prospects.\"\n- You should use transitions between paragraphs to show the logical connections between your ideas. For example, you could start your second paragraph with \"To understand the effects of 'lying flat' on college students, we need to first examine how prevalent this phenomenon is in China.\" You could also use words like \"however\", \"therefore\", \"in contrast\", etc. to show contrast, cause-effect, or comparison between different points.\n- You should provide more evidence and analysis to support your claims. For example, you could cite some statistics or studies that show how 'lying flat' affects college students' grades, skills, motivation, etc. You could also explain how these effects may influence their future opportunities and challenges in the job market or society.\n- You should avoid using vague or subjective words like \"many\", \"some\", \"a lot\", etc. without specifying the source or quantity. For example, instead of saying \"many studies prove that 'lying flat' has both negative and positive impacts\", you could say \"according to a survey by Zhao pin[^4^], a leading career platform in China, 35% of white-collar workers reported feeling less stressed and more satisfied after adopting a 'lying flat' lifestyle, while 65% reported lower income and career prospects.\"\n- You should use formal and academic language and avoid using contractions, slang, or informal expressions.
